= Checking external links

You can check whether external `http(s)` links in the active document are valid.
If a link is not valid, it is reported in the `PROBLEMS` panel.
If an `http` link has a valid `https` variant, it is suggested in the `PROBLEMS` panel as well.

. Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] and start typing `daps`.
. Select the `DAPS: Check for broken links` command.
. Check the `PROBLEMS` panel for reports of broken links.
  These are underlined within the open document.

== Relevant options

daps.linkCheckIgnoreList::
  Ignore checking URLs that include these phrases.
  For example:

[source,yaml]
----
"daps.linkCheckIgnoreList":
[
  "localhost",
  "example"
]
----

daps.linkCheckOnSave::
  Check for broken links when a file is saved.
  If enabled, all links in the active document are check on each save which may waste system resources.
  Default is `disabled` which means that you need to invoke the link check manually by running the `DAPS: Check for broken links` command.
