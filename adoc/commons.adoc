[#vscode-daps-commons-builddc]

If you prefer typing to mouse movements, you can run the build command from the Command Palette:

. Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] and start typing `daps`.
. When available, select the `DAPS: Build with DC file` command.
. Select the DC file from the populated list and choose whether to build `pdf` or `html`.

TIP: After the build is finished, you can directly open the resulting document
or copy its path to a clipboard.

[#vscode-daps-commons-buildroot]
== Building a document by its root ID

Besides building a whole book, you can build only a part of it, for example, a chapter or a topic.
To achieve this, you need to specify a top-level element ID:

. Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] and start typing `daps`.
. Select the `DAPS: Build with root ID` command.
. Select the DC file from the populated list, then the root ID to build.
. Finally, choose whether to build `pdf` or `html`.

IMPORTANT: Populating the list of root IDs can take a few seconds.

Alternatively, you can select and build the root ID from the active editor:

. Select the root ID by the mouse and right-click the selection.
. Select menu:DAPS[Build with root ID].
. Select the DC file from the populated list and choose whether to build `pdf` or `html`.
