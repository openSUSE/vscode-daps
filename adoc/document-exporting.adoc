[#vscode-daps-commons-builddc-palette]
== By specifying a DC file from the Command Palette

If you prefer typing to mouse movements, you can run the build command from the Command Palette:

. Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] and start typing `daps`.
. When available, select the `DAPS: Build with DC file` command.
. Select the DC file from the populated list and choose whether to build `pdf` or `html`.

TIP: After the build is finished, you can directly open the resulting document or copy its path to a clipboard.

[#vscode-daps-commons-buildroot-palette]
== By specifying a top-level ID from the Command Palette


Besides building a whole book, you can build only a part of it, for example, a chapter or a topic.
To achieve this, you need to specify a top-level element ID:

. Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] and start typing `daps`.
. Select the `DAPS: Build with root ID` command.
. Select the DC file from the populated list, then the root ID to build.
. Finally, choose whether to build `pdf` or `html`.
