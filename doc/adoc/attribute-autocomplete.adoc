[#vscode-daps-attribute-autocomplete]
= Autocompleting entities/attributes

For the autocomplete to work, the active document must include entity/attribute definitions such as

----
:osuse:   "openSUSE" # for AsciiDoc
<!ENTITY osuse   "openSUSE"> # for DocBook
----

or include a file with entities/attributes similarly to

----
include::../common/attributes.adoc # for AsciiDoc
<!ENTITY % entities SYSTEM "../common/generic-entities.ent"> # for DocBook
----

Start typing `{` (AsciiDoc) or `&` (DocBook) and the editor tries to find the right attribute as you type.
